This section provides a foundational overview of the key terms and concepts relevant to understanding the migration of cloud-edge systems. First, we define cloud-edge orchestration and the related concepts that form the basis of this thesis. Next, we explore the term "migration," clarifying its meaning in this context and distinguishing between stateless and stateful migration. Finally, we examine the networking aspect, focusing on establishing secure connections between the origin and target environments. In this context, we delve into two approaches: tunneling and service meshes.

% TODO: orchestrated environments lassen oder spezifisch kubernetes clusters schreiben?
This paper showed an implementation of how a tool for migrating orchestrated environments could be built and an evaluation of this tool. 
To answer our contribution of our tool, we conclude that we achieved an almost seamless application migration in edge and fog computing environments with an availability of over $98\%$.
With our tool we are able to establish a secure tunnel between our environments by using Submariner, migrate stateful application by replicating PostgreSQL databases and forward incoming traffic by rerouting it with a reverse proxy.

While our implementation and evaluation of this tool provided important insights, it also highlighted issues that require further investigation.
The evaluation of this tool was performed using single node clusters, which does not reflect reality.
In future experiments, it would be interesting to benchmark multi-node clusters to see if the tool's results are comparable.
In order to handle traffic forwarding in a more efficient and generic way, different proxy solutions or service meshes that also sound promising, should be investigated in future work.
It would also be interesting to look at migrating different database types such as NoSQL or key-value stores to cover a wider variety of storage methods.
